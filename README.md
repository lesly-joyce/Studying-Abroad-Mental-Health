# 🌍 Impact of Studying Abroad on Students' Mental Health

## 🧠 Context

This project analyzes whether studying in a foreign country affects the mental health of international students. The data comes from a Japanese university that conducted a study in 2018.

The analysis focuses on:

* The link between **acculturative stress** and **depression**
* The impact of **length of stay** abroad
* The role of **social connectedness**

## 🗂️ Dataset

* `students.csv`: dataset containing responses from international students
* Variables: acculturative stress, depression, length of stay, connectedness, etc.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* SQL (simulated in DataCamp)
* Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Project Steps

1. Introduction and sociological context
2. Data exploration and variable description
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. SQL queries to cross key variables
5. Visualization of results
6. Conclusion on predictive factors of mental distress

## 📎 Findings

> Students with low social connectedness and high acculturative stress are at higher risk of depression. Length of stay moderately influences this risk.
